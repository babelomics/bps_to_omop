    "- `vocab_dir` is the path from `data_dir` to the directory where the vocabulary tables (CONCEPT, CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP, etc.) are.\n",

    "- `fallback_vocabs` is an **optional** parameter used in case there are source values that could not be mapped. It contains a dict where keys are vocabularies and values are:\n",
    "  - `concept_code` to map to concept_codes within the vocabulary.\n",
    "  - `concept_name` to map to concept_names within the vocabulary.\n",
    "- `append_vocabulary` is a dict that defines, for each file in `input_files`, the name of the vocabulary to be added as a new uniform column.\n",
    "  - i.e. a new column, `vocabulary_id`, will be added to the table with the provided value for every row.\n",
    "  - This entry is not mandatory.\n",
    "- `column_map` is a dict that defines, for each file in `input_files`, the column that will be renamed to `source_value` to perform the identification of codes in the CONCEPT table.\n",
    "  - It can be used to rename any other column if needed.\n",
    "- `vocabulary_config` is a dict that defines, for each file in `input_files`, how to perform the mapping from each vocabulary to the concept_table\n",
    "  - Defines a map between each vocabulary present in the file (key) and what column in the CONCEPT table, i.e. concept_name or concept_code, should be used for mapping (value).\n",
    "  - Each source_value has to be mapped to a concept in the CONCEPT table. Usually the source values are either descriptors (which map to concept_name), or codes (which map to concept_code)\n",

    "Important notes:\n",
    "- The parameters `input_dir` and `output_dir` are defined in relation to the `data_dir` folder defined in the `.env` file. \n",
    "- Even though mapping from multiple vocabularies is allowed with the `vocabulary_config` parameter, the assignation of multiple `vocabulary_id` values cannot currently be performed here and has to be done in the `process_rare_files` stage."
