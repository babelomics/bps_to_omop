    "Roughly described, each step performs the following functions:\n",
    "1. **retrieve_raw_data**: Data is fetched from an external directory, *Clinical raw data*. \n",
    "2. **process_raw_data**: The original data is read and brought into parquet format. **No** data transformations are performed, just an attempt to read and save the data in the proper format so that it can be read quickly in the future using parquet files. \n",
    "  - This simplifies access to files and speeds up future transformations.\n",
    "3. **process_rare_data**: The parquet data is processed to facilitate the following steps. Data transformations/purges, if any, should be applied here.\n",
    "  - This process, if needed, is mostly manual. Somo general things can be done, like dropping duplicates or invalid rows, but the specific depends largely on the each project and file, so no attemp for generalization has been made.\n",
    "  - If something fails in the following steps or generation OMOP tables, the most easy solution is to fix it in this stage.\n",
    "  - This step also serves as a registry of \"weird things\" that had to be done to the data in order to prepare it.\n",
    "  - Some things that should be done in this stage:\n",
    "    - Join files with the same information.\n",
    "    - Separate files that contain too much information (OMOP-generation files expect only two dates by file: start of event, end of event. If more than one file is present)\n",
    "4. **omopization**: The processed data are prepared to facilitate their transfer to OMOP format. Here columns are created or renamed for later use.\n",
    "  - Things that are done here:\n",
    "    - Generation of the unique person_id across all files to prevent inconsistencies.\n",
    "    - Standarization of column names to omop-like equivalents.\n",
    "    - Generation of a type_concept_id code to identify the origin of the information. This code will be carried over to every OMOP table.\n",
    "5. **retrieve_OMOP_vocab_tables**: Data with extended vocabularies are retrieved from a remote directory. See the [MappingToOMOP](http://gitlab.cbra.com/igutierrez/MappingToOmop) repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this process, all data should be in a bps_to_omop friendly format and the generation of the OMOP tables can begin.\n"

    "## 2. Generation of the OMOP tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the original files are \"omopized\", we can start building the OMOP tables themselves. Depending on the original data, not every table needs to be built. This generates a situation where a general procedure to build every table is not optimal, hence, we have provided single script for each table that rely on bps_to_omop modules. Which tables to build depends almost entirely on the specifics of the original data.\n",

    "It is important to determine which tables need to be built first. Usually, VISIT_OCCURRENCE is the next step after OBSERVATION_PERIOD, but VISIT_OCCURRENCE can reference entries in the LOCATION table. If that's the case, LOCATION should be built before VISIT_OCCURRENCE.\n",
