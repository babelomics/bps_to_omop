    "## 2. Generation of the OMOP tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the original files are \"omopized\", we can start building the OMOP tables themselves. Depending on the original data, not every table needs to be built. This generates a situation where a general procedure to build every table is not optimal, hence, we have provided single script for each table that rely on bps_to_omop modules. Which tables to build depends almost entirely on the specifics of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take into accoutn that, tables CDM_SOURCE, PERSON and OBSERVATION_PERIOD are always mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to study the original data and plan ahead what tables would be needed for the current project. As an example, if our main goal is to create the tables PERSON, CONDITION_OCCURRENCE and MEASUREMENT, the process can be summarized in the following diagram:"

    "It is important to determine which tables need to be built first. Usually, VISIT_OCCURRENCE is the next step after OBSERVATION_PERIOD, but VISIT_OCCURRENCE can reference entries in the LOCATION table. If that's the case, LOCATION should be built before VISIT_OCCURRENCE.\n",
