In this case we have to gather all those files that contain information about a patient's interaction with the health system. Not all files have this info, e.g. sociodemo does not include info about anything other than date of birth, gender and the id itself. These files do not need to be taken into account.\n",

By default we indicate 365 days, but this can be modified in the params file. The function `group_dates()` in the [general](../bps_to_omop/general.py) module then joins together every interaction that each patient had if the time passed between them is below a certain threshold, usually 365 days.\n"
