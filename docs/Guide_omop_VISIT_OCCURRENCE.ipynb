    "The parameters are:\n",
    "- `files_to_use`: Defines the files that should be used to assemble this table. The others will be ignored, even if they appear in files_list. \n",
    "- `transformations`: Defines the transformations that must be made to the file before incorporating it to the rest of the data. \n",
    "  - A clear example would be one in which the column `end_date` is not reliable or relevant. So it is replaced by a copy of start_date.\n",
    "  - Transformations are performed by functions that operate on pyarrow tables. See [table_transformer.py](../external/bps_to_omop/bps_to_omop/table_transformer.py).\n",
    "- `visit_concept_dict`: Dictionary indicating the order of the codes to apply and how to apply them. Right now there are three options:\n",
    "    - `single_code`: Applies one code to all cases.\n",
    "        - When the file has only one code.\n",
    "    - `field_code`: Applies a code only to cases where the `column` column has the value `column_value`.\n",
    "        - Useful when the visit type is encoded in a column inside the file.\n",
    "    - `duration_code`: Applies a code only to cases where the interval between end_date and start_date is within maximum and minimum value.\n",
    "        - Useful when the type of visit depends on its duration. E.g. if it is a one day visit to the hospital, it is an outpatient, if it is more than one day, it is probably an inpatient.\n",
    "    - It is important to note that the order matters. At first code 0 is assigned to all rows, then the functions are applied in order. Therefore, the last entry will take precedence in case it is applied to more than one record. \n",
    "- `visit_concept_order`: Hierarchy for the codes used. This is used when grouping visits. Multiday visits cannot overlap. In case two visits occur during the same period, one must contain the other. This order identifies which visit should be kept and which should be discarded.\n",
    "- `remove_overlap`: Defines the parameters to detect and proceed when two rows are overlapping. The procedure works by first sorting the rows and then removing all rows contained in a previous row. Since only the first row will be kept, order is important.\n",
    "  - `sorting_columns`: Columns to be used for sorting. Usually: [\"person_id\", \"start_date\", \"end_date\", \"visit_concept_id\"]\n",
    "  - `ascending_order`: Bool indicating if sorting should be ascending or not. [True, True, False, True]"
